    "## Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop user-independent pre-processing and classification models to recognize 7 different physical exercises measured by accelerometer (attached to subject's thigh) and depth camera (above the subject facing downwards recording an aerial view). All the exercises were performed subject lying down on the mat. Original dataset have also another acceleration sensor and pressure-sensitive mat, but those two modalities are ommited in this project. There are totally 30 subjects in the original dataset, and in this work subset of 10 person is utilized. Detailed description of the dataset and original data can be access in [MEx dataset @ UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MEx#). We are providing the subset of dataset in Moodle.\n",

    "where 1-4 are compulsory (max. 10 points each), and 5 is optional to get bonus points (max. 5+5 points). In each phase, you should visualize and analyse the results and document the work and findings properly by text blocks and figures between the code. <b> Nice looking </b> and <b> informative </b> notebook representing your results and analysis will be part of the grading in addition to actual implementation.\n",

Similar to related article \"MEx: Multi-modal Exercises Dataset for Human Activity Recognition\", use 5 second window and 3 second overlapping between windows, producing several example sequences from one exercise file for classification purposes. Windowing is working so that starting from the beginning of each long exercise sequence, take 5 seconds of data points (from synchronized acceleration data and depth images) based on the time stamps. Next, move the window 2 seconds forward and take another 5 seconds of data. Then continue this until your are at the end of sequence.

    "2.1 Calculate PCA and LDA transformations to reduce the dimensionality of accelerometer data (e.g., using scikit-learn implementations). Before transformations downsample data from 100 Hz to 25 Hz (using scipy.signal.resample) to get 125x3 matrix of data for each 5 sec window. You should also standardize the values to zero mean and unit variance before the transformations. Using training dataset, fit PCA with 5-dimensional subspace (i.e., choosing the 5 largest principal components) and fit LDA with 5-dimensional subspace. Transform both train and test examples to this low-dimensional feature representation. Concatenate each sequence to single vector size of 3x(5+5). Perform the fusion of PCA and LDA similar manner as presented in Lecture 3 (pages-19-20) using NN method. Evaluate the performance on testset. Show confusion matrix and F1 scores of the results."

Train the base classifiers by tuning the model parameters (<i>C</i> parameter and RBF-kernel <i>gamma</i> in SVM as well as <i>n_estimators</i> and <i>learning_rate</i> in Adaboost) using 10-fold cross-validation on training dataset to find optimal set of parameters (hint: use GridSearchCV from scikit-learn). For grid search use the following values $C = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]$, $gamma=[0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0]$, $n\\_estimators = [50, 100, 500, 1000]$, and $learning\\_rate = [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1.0]$.
